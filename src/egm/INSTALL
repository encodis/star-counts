This file contains installation instructions for the External Galaxy Model,
version 1.7.

Read the file MANIFEST and check that you have all the required files.

If you are reading this file you have probably unpacked the archive file 
already. If not then read the README file and unpack the files.

To compile and run EGM you will need to have an ANSI C compiler on your system.
The FSF compiler "gcc" works just fine (EGM was written under it). The SunOS
compiler "cc" will not work - the ANSI C version "acc" probably will, though 
this has not been tested. On a PC using MS-DOS any ANSI compliant C compiler 
should work. The port of "gcc" to DOS machines ("djgpp") has been tested and 
is known to work.

Now edit the file "Makefile". Change the definition of the "DEFS" variable to 
a library of CMD and LF files. If you don't have a such a library read the
README file and get a copy of one. Install it separately. You can also change
"BINDIR" to point to where you want the executable installed. Edit "CFLAGS" if
you like - it's not a good idea to change anything else.

On a DOS machine running DJGPP type:

	make egm.exe

On anything else type:

	make egm

If everything compiles successfully type:

	make install
	make clean

To make a PostScript copy of the documentation type:

	make manual

This requires that you have the LaTeX document preparation system and the
"dvips" program on your system.
